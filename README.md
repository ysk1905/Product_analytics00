**classify the users based on the data analyzed so far?**

  Most number of users (407) are returning back to the app after a gap of 1 day, which is a healthy sign. The most popular session is session type C which brings in the most users after their profile creation. I would classify the users mainly on the basis of the session type they are interacting with. 

**What else intrigued you in this data set? What would you like to probe further?**

  The ability to be able to track the gaps in which user is returning back to the app is helpful. But if we would have been able to track how long the user is in the app in terms of minutes or hours, that would have been even more advantageous. This is because we still don't know how long the user is staying inside the applicaition or just quitting right away.
  
#Q2. What is the probability of generating ten consecutive numbers in ascending order out of 100 numbers? Map out your process.

  Chossing 10 numbers from 100 numbers can be done in 100c10 ways.Now, 10 numbers from 100 numbers in consecutive ways can be done in 91 ways.Which means the probability is 91/100c10.

#Q3. Estimate the number of petrol kiosks/gas stations in your city. Map out your thought process.

  The population of my native city, Bhopal is 92 Lakh. Let's assume that there is vehicle for every 4 people. Which means there are 23 Lakh vehicles currently running. One vehicle needs to visit the gas station every 2 weeks on an average. This means everyday around 2 lakh vehicle are in need of a gas station. If one gas station takes in 250 vehicles in a day there are approximately 800 gas stations in Bhopal
